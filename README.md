This signs a S3 URL

Add an expire time


It makes something like this https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/folder/folder/file.html?AWSAccessKeyId=AAIJBKUWCWE5AIDP3GMV&Expires=2133721337&Signature=zpN5I/VVYZ0tWBKcxmIGbkTeJ0RN/X+aFu6WD2UN


Don't give your keys to anyone, don't upload your keys to a website to sign you S3 URLs.

Clean tiny program easy to read over and see the program does one thing well.


Enjoy:)
